# Topic of the Assignment number 4 :
In this assignment, we are expected to design a “Pokemon game” in which given a weighted graph,  a set of “Agents” should be located on it so they could “catch” as many “Pokemons” as possible. The pokemons are located on the graph’s (directed) edges, therefore, the agent needs to take (aka walk)  the proper edge to “grab” the pokemon. The goal is to maximize the overall sum of weights of the “grabbed” pokemons (while not exceeding the maximum amount of server calls allowed in a second - 10 max).
